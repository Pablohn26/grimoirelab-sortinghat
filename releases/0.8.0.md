## sortinghat 0.8.0 - (2023-02-01)

**New features:**

 * Migration command for SortingHat 0.7 (#726)\
   Include a new command to migrate SortingHat 0.7 database schema to
   0.8. The command can be executed as `sortinghat-admin migrate-old-
   database`. It will migrate all the data from the old version.

**Bug fixes:**

 * GraphQL client headers updated\
   SortingHat client headers are updated adding `Referer` and `Host` to
   fix the CSRF token issue.

**Breaking changes:**

 * SortingHat as a service\
   SortingHat started as a command line tool but, after some years, we
   saw its potential and we decided to create a new version of it. Now,
   it works as an individual service.  This new version provides a new
   GraphQL API to operate with the server and a UI web-based app, that
   replaces Hatstall, the old UI for SortingHat.  Moreover, the new
   version adds some features requested long time ago, such as
   groups/teams management, recommendations of affiliations and
   individuals, or a totally renwed user interface.
